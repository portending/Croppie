# Fuck public cropping tools!!  <br>
For some stupid reason, they all SUCK or dont have very good features, or just do things inconvientaly. This is where croppie comes in hand! It.. it literally is just a image cropping tool with some extra tools and QOL, still easier to use then imageresizer.com and iloveimg.com's resize tools.<br>
> Do note this isnt perfect or finished yet, but its pretty nice to use for me so far :D <br>
Thanks for stopping by and make sure to star the projects repo <3 <br>
